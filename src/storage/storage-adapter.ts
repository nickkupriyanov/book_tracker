/**
 * Persistence contract for the books library.
 *
 * The MVP ships {@link LocalStorageAdapter}; a future spec will add
 * {@link HttpStorageAdapter} that conforms to this same interface so the
 * UI and the Zustand store don't need to change when the backend arrives.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - The interface is **persistence only** — it does not own in-memory state.
 *   The Zustand store owns the in-memory list and delegates persistence
 *   to the adapter (plan D-P1 / §5).
 * - Errors are not caught here. Implementations throw on real failure
 *   (quota, disabled storage, network, …) and the caller (store / dialog)
 *   decides what to do.
